            In the land of Far Far Away, where fairy tales come to play,<br>
            Lived a mighty ogre, Shrek the Slayer, bold and brave each day.<br><br>

            With a roar that shook the trees and a heart as pure as gold,<br>
            He defended the weak, his legend forever told.<br><br>

            Through forests dark and dungeons deep, he fought with all his might,<br>
            A hero in the shadows, bringing justice to the night.<br><br>

            So raise your voices high, let the bards proclaim,<br>
            The Ballard of Shrek the Slayer, forever in our name.

            In the land of Far Far Away, where tales of old are spun,<br>
            There lived a talking donkey, whose adventures had just begun.<br><br>

            With a heart full of courage and a spirit wild and free,<br>
            He stood by Shrek's side, as loyal as could be.<br><br>

            Through trials and tribulations, their bond grew ever strong,<br>
            A friendship forged in fire, where they both belonged.<br><br>

            So let the minstrels sing, let the stories be told,<br>
            The Ballard of Shrek's Donkey, a legend to behold.

            But beneath her royal guise, a secret she did keep,<br>
            A curse that turned her into an ogre when the night did creep.<br><br>

            Yet love transcended all, as Shrek came into her life,<br>
            Together they defied the odds, husband and wife.<br><br>
